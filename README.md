# Smart-Environment

first challenge:
In the dataset you have the packets received gateways which are placed in different areas (indoor, outdoor, etc.). The positioning of the gateways will influence how many packets they receive and their radio indicators such as RSSI and SNR.

Moreover, in LoRa the Spreading Factor (SF) parameter controls the time-on-air of a packet. The higher SF is, the more probable is for a gateway to receive a packet.

Derive the distribution of the RSSI and SF for each gateway
